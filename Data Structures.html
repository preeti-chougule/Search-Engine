Data Structures and Algorithms

Course Focus: Study of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) to solve computational problems efficiently.
Subtopics:
Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
Binary trees, heaps, graphs
Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort)
Graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm)
Time and space complexity (Big O notation)
